# About this repository

This repository contains the data and code neccesary to reproduce the findings discussed in the Policy Brief titled: __Higher Poverty Associated with Lower Life Expectancy in Pennsylvania__ published by the [Administrative Data Accelerator](accelerator.psu.edu) at the [Pennsylvania State University](www.psu.edu).

Each folder has a description file that provides additional information about the files contained on them. 

If you are having problems with the code, feel free to create an [Issue](https://github.com/alexisrsantos/PA_life_expectancy_ADA/issues) and I will work on it.

This repository is managed by [Dr. Alexis R. Santos](sites.psu.edu/alexisrsantos) (ars39@psu.edu) and is part of the Policy Outreach initiated within the [Administrative Data Accelerator](accelerator.psu.edu). 

Within the Administrative Data Accelerator, I work as a Demography Data Fellow.
